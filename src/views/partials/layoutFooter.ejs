                    This is a demonstration proof-of-concept microservice developed as part of the master
                    thesis <em>"Open dat in scientific research"</em> by <a href="https://www.ondrejdoktor.cz" target="_blank">Ondřej Doktor</a>
                    at the <a href="https://www.prf.jcu.cz/en/uai" target="_blank">Institute of applied informatics</a>, Faculty of Science, University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice, Czech Republic.

                    Goal of this thesis is to investigate practical aspects of <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/fairification-process/" target="_blank">FAIRification</a>
                    in relation to the existing scientific data resources which are being produced at the faculty,
                    suggest processes and best-practices for doing so, and demonstrate successful application of these by implementing them on a simplified dataset, which is based on real data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The output You are looking at is produced by the microservice solving this goal. This work is closely related to the <a href="https://www.unicatdb.org">UniCatDB project</a> - Universal Catalog Database for biological findings.
